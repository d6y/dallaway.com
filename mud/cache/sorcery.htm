      is based on Steve Jackson's award-winning interactive gamebook series, 
      originally published in the UK by Penguin Books. Sorcery has since been 
      licensed to publishers in 15 countries around the world and has sold over 
      a million copies to date.<BR><BR>Sorcery distinguishes itself from other 
      Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks by setting the hero (the reader) as a wizard, 
      with an inventory of spells to learn. It was by far the most ambitious 
      interactive gamebook series ever created, comprising four individual 
      books. As the reader completes one book, the scene is set for the next. 
      Titles in the series are:<BR><BR>Adventure 1: <I>The Shamutanti 
      Hills</I><BR>Adventure 2: <I>Khare - Cityport of Traps</I><BR>Adventure 3: 
      <I>The Seven Serpents</I><BR>Adventure 4: <I>The Crown of 
      Kings</I><BR><BR>The adventure itself is of epic proportions, comprising 
      over 2250 game-paragraphs in total. Taking Jackson over two and a half 
      years to write, the plot sends the reader on a grand quest across the 
      forbidding Land of Kakhabad in search of the fabled Crown of 
      Kings.<BR><BR>"I always felt that Sorcery was my best work within the 
      Fighting Fantasy series." said Steve Jackson. And I always hoped one day 
      it would be the basis for a computer-based game. I'm very excited about 
      this project, particularly the multi-player aspect. Sorcery was originally 
      a solo game, but WAP technology offers new horizons that were never 
      possible with books." </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
