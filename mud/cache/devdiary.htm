      <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif><BR><BR><B>24 July 
      2000</B><BR>Magic. It is - after all - a game based on magic, but how to 
      make the system worth something with a limited graphic set, and how to 
      make it more than just another set of options - which worked so well for 
      the books.<BR><BR>On top of this, how do we keep it fresh?<BR><BR>So - the 
      magic system we have…without giving too much away…is component based. You 
      play through the game amassing components. Then it is up to the player to 
      work out which components work with which. Some are obvious - a lot are 
      less so.<BR><BR>The other difference is in the method of casting spells. 
      In the book it cost STAM. In this version of the game - where possible - 
      the player loses STAM by sacrificing blood. This gives us a gothic edge to 
      our magic system.<BR><BR>The joy of the component system is in its utter 
      freedom. We can set up items for the player to use in later books, as well 
      as provide an enormously open system for players to create their own 
      spells. <BR><BR><BR><B>30 June 2000</B><BR>So - the first entry in a diary 
      that will stop everyone saying "You've got such a cool job!". The basic 
      starting point is, of course, the books. We have a really great game 
      mechanic for combat and plotting a path through an adventure...if you have 
      a book. Both Steve and I wanted something that would take advantage of the 
      WAP technology while neatly avoiding some of its drawbacks. This was a 
      long task in itself. We wanted a graphical combat system, an animated 
      magic system and, as much as possible, a graphical front end. And so we 
      faced every problem known to WAP - minimal processing on the phone, 
      graphics stored in cache, the trade-off between connecting often for small 
      amounts of data or less often and dragging down loads of data.<BR><BR>At 
      the end I think we came up with a good set of options - a great 
      interactive combat system, a magic system that builds throughout the game, 
      and our graphical front end. How this all looks I'll cover as this diary 
      goes on and we look at different sections of the game. However, now plot 
      additions and new areas are demanding my attention. And that's your 
      cliffhanger. In the next section I'll look at the enhancements we're 
      making to the game for play on a Mobile Phone.</FONT>
