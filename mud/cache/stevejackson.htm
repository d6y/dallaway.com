      co-founder and Director of renowned games development outfit Lionhead 
      Studios, has long held a venerated position within the world of 
      interactive games, with a string of established successes such as the 
      Games Workshop, F.I.S.T, Battlecards and the Fighting Fantasy Gamebook 
      series already under his belt.<BR><BR>Steve Jackson is also an old hand at 
      designing games played over telephone networks. In 1989 he wrote and 
      directed the world's first telephone adventure game: F.I.S.T. (Fantasy 
      Interactive Scenarios by Telephone). FIST played like an interactive radio 
      drama. It was a lavish production, using professional voice actors and 
      hundreds of different sound effects.<BR><BR>"FIST has done incredibly 
      well," said Jackson, "But it had limitations, as it has only been 
      available to callers within a single territory. WAP-enabled phones have 
      much more potential and, in theory, anyone in the world can play Sorcery 
      on-line. It's a scary thought." </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
