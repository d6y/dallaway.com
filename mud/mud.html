<h1>MUD to WAP gateway</h1>

<p>Richard Dallaway</p>
<p>2000-06-14</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Text-based adventure games (MUDs, MOOs)
are characterised by real-time social interactions between players.
This document describes an architecture for accessing MUDs via
WAP-enabled mobile devices.</P>
<h2>Principles</h2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">There are a wide variety of MUDs
running on different platforms with a different themes and
conventions.  The common element is that they are based on
asynchronous free text flow over sockets: there is no higher-level
protocol, such as HTTP, involved.
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">Players send commands as free text back
to the server.  The servers parse the free text commands and
interpret the message as actions.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">A MUD to WML gateway would have to:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Convert the text from the MUD to a
	WML representation suitable for the the mobile device.  In
	particular this will mean buffering the asynchronous data from the
	server and cutting the received text into suitable sized decks.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Maintain state between the mobile
	client and the MUD server.  That is, the gateway will be providing
	services to multiple users playing on different MUDs, and therefore
	has to know how to direct text flow between the appropriate parties.
	 This is a function of the gateway because WAP, like HTTP, is a
	state-less protocol.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal">Add usability elements by
	hot-linking common MUD commands or provide commands on a options
	soft-key: exit, south, north, east, west, up, down, flee, save,
	status, inventory.</P>
</OL>

<h1>Architecture</h1>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The proposed configuration is shown in
figure 1.</P>

</P>
<h2>Buffering</h2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Text send from the server is
asynchronous.  However, the WML content sent to the mobile client has
to be a complete XML document before it is rendered: there cannot be
an ongoing dialogue to the client (not until someone invents
&quot;waplets&quot;).  The buffer will receive and store anything
sent from the server on behalf of the mobile client.   The page
control element will decide what should be sent to the client and
when.</P>
<h2>Page control</h2>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The page control has four functions:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Ensuring content is small enough
	to send to the mobile client.  This means cutting content into
	multiple pages when necessary.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Making any required WML entity
	mappings (e.g., &amp; translated to &amp;amp; and so on) and adding
	appropriate WML tags.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Adding navigation or MUD specific
	commands into the WML deck.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Controlling when enough
	information has been received to send to the client.</P>
</OL>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">Point four deals with the asynchronous
aspect of the MUD communication.  The problem is this: when do you
decide that there is an appropriate break in the output from the MUD
server?  This is no prompt or protocol headers to say &quot;and now
it's the client's turn to send something&quot;.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: medium">The following is proposed:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">All content send from the server
	is stored in the buffer.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If there is a 500 ms pause in the
	sending of the content after a new line character, then the content
	is sent to the client.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If there is a total of a two
	second pause in the content sent to the buffer, and there is also
	content in the buffer, then the content is sent to the client.
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-weight: medium">If there is no content in the
	buffer, and there is a five second pause, the client may be sent the
	text &quot;waiting for server to respond&quot;.</P>
	<LI><P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium">Nothing else can be sent to
	the client until the client makes a request: either sending a
	command, which may just be a blank command (&quot;hitting return&quot;
	or requesting &quot;get more&quot;</SPAN>).  If the client requests
	more content and there is nothing in the buffer (cf. point 4) then
	the client will see the &quot;waiting for server to respond&quot;
	message.</P>
</OL>
<h2>Session management</h2>
<P>At this time it is not possible to rely on HTTP-style cookies to
work with all WAP gateways.  As a result the MUD to WAP gateway will
have to maintain a unique session variable for each client.  This
will be an integer sent with every request from the client as a
&quot;hidden value&quot; in a form.  The gateway will be responsible
for including this value for each page it sends to the mobile client.</P>

<h1>Interface</h1>
<h2>Screen 1: home page</h2>
<P>Two links:</P>
<P>(a) popular MUDs (go to screen 2)</P>
<P>(b) custom MUD (go to screen 3)</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<h2>Screen 2: popular MUDs</h2>
<P> A list of links showing popular MUD names.  Note that this list
can be evolved based on the paramters users enter via the custom MUD
option.</P>
<P>The links will take the user to screen 4.</P>
<h2>Screen 3: custom MUD</h2>
<P>This is a form allow the user to enter hostname or IP address of a
MUD server and the port.</P>
<P>Submitting the form will take the user to screen 4.</P>
<h2>Screen 4: confirmation</h2>
<P>This page shows the user the choice of mud they are about to
enter.  It allows the user to bookmark the selection.</P>
<P>Following an ENTER link will take the user to screen 5.</P>
<h2>Screen 5: game play</h2>
<P>Response from the server are shown on this page.  At the end of
the page there is a form allowing the user to send back commands to
the MUD server.</P>
<P>Popular commands will be shown on the options soft key.  These
will be:</P>
<P>exits, inventory, north, east, south, west, up, down, flee, who,
save, quit.</P>
<P>An on-going project could be to try to  parse the MUD server
output to insert context sensitive commands such as:  kill troll,
swing sword, exam corpse, say to jono, read sign.</P>
<P>The user should be encouraged to respond quickly because there MUD
to WAP gateway may be buffering important MUD events (such as &quot;the
sprit hits you with sword&quot; and so on).</P>
