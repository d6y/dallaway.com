<h1>Things I have written down</h1>
<br>


<ul>

<li> <a href="release-hell/">Making software development a little bit more reliable</a>

<p class="bkquote">All the developers I know hate &quot;last minute release
hell&quot;. This is the frenzy of
activity that hits when the time comes to release or ship the thing you've been
working on. I have no magic bullets to stop this problem from ever
occurring, but on a recent project I was struck by the blindingly obvious, and
I thought I'd share.</p>

<li> <a href="apple/">MacOS X notes</a>
<p class="bkquote">I've switched.</p>

<li> <a href="javaone2003/">JavaOne 2003, San Francisco</a>
<p class="bkquote">My notes from this conference.</p>

<li> <a href="dtd/">DTDs and XML Catalogs</a>
<p class="bkquote">
Notes on how to map document type defintions to local files, thereby
side-stepping various hellish DTD issues.
</p>

<li> <a href="spindle/">Spindle and Lucene for web site indexing and search</a>
<p class="bkquote">
I switched a few site searches over from using a Swish-e CGI to using a Java-based packaged called Spindle.
These are my notes. The summary is: it works very well.
</p>
<li> <a href="webstart/">Java Web Start and Code Signing</a>
<p class="bkquote">
My notes on getting going with Java Web Start for deploying applications over the internet, and learning how to digitally sign code on the cheap.
</p>


<li> <a href="cbd/">Outsourced component development</a>
<p class="bkquote">
My first attempt at commissioning some code development via an internet auction.
</p>



<li> <a href="adsl/">USB ADSL with RedHat Linux 7.1</a>
<p class="bkquote">
My notes on what I had to do to get USB ADSL working on my machine with RedHat Linux 7.1 and the 2.4.9 kernel.
</p>


<li> <a href="vaio.html">Notes on upgrading a Vaio Z600HEK to Windows 2000 Advanced Server and RedHat Linux 7.1</a>
<p class="bkquote">
Very much a work in progress.  The W2k part works, and what I've tried under Linux works... but I've not tried enough yet.
</p>



<li> <a href="dbunit.html">Unit testing database functionality</a>
<p class="bkquote">
My notes on how I've gone about unit testing database functionality.
The examples are in Java, but I think the ideas are applicable to a variety
of programming environments.
</p>


<li> The <a href="../palm/index.html">software I run on my Palm</a> computing device.
<p class="bkquote">

</p>



<li> <a href="../mud/index.html">Proposal for accessing MUDs from mobile devices.</a>
<p class="bkquote">
A technical note on how you could play existing multi-users games on WAP devices. If you wanted to.
</p>


<li> <a href="evolution/evocog.html">Genetic programming and cognitive models</a>
<p class="bkquote">
An introductory note on GP for a conference:
Genetic programming (GP) is a general purpose method for evolving symbolic computer programs
(e.g. Lisp code). Concepts from genetic algorithms are used to evolve a population of initially
random programs so that they are able to solve the problem at hand. This paper describes genetic
programming and discuss the usefulness of the method for building cognitive models. Although
it appears that an arbitrary fit to the training examples will be evolved, it is shown that GP
can be constrained to produce small, general programs.
</p>


<li> <a href="/pondlife/">Demonstrations of some simple chaos functions</a>
<p class="bkquote">
This is an odd one: something I wrote a long time ago, and haven't linked to
for years, but it keeps on getting hits according
to my server logs.  Don't know why.  It's not the graphics, that's for sure or the writing.
Could be the two applets for plotting <a href="/pondlife/LogisticGraph.html">logisitc equation</a>
and <a href="/pondlife/Bifurcation.html">bifurcations</a>.  Anyway, so I thought it was
time to recreate the link.  

</p>

<li> <a href="dphil/toc.html">The Dynamics of Arithmetic: A connectionist view of arithmetic skills</a>.
<p class="bkquote">
Children have acquired a host of impressive skills by the time they are taught formal arithmetic: they have learned a language and can navigate in a hostile environment. In contrast, the "simple" tasks of arithmetic require at least a further five or six years of schooling. Once the skills are learned there are many opportunities for error. Adults, for example, make plenty of mistakes recalling multiplication facts -- especially on the "tricky" problems, such as 8x4 or 9x8. Arithmetic, it seems, is not an easy skill to come by.
