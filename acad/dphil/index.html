<P>
<font size=+1>CHILDREN</font> HAVE ACQUIRED a
host of impressive skills by the time they are taught formal arithmetic:
they have learned a language and can navigate in a hostile environment.
In contrast, the "simple" tasks of arithmetic
require at least a further five or six years of schooling. Once the skills
are learned there are many opportunities for error. Adults, for example,
make plenty of mistakes recalling multiplication facts -- especially on the
"tricky" problems, such as 8x4 or 9x8. Arithmetic, it seems, is not an
easy skill to come by.

<P>

So what is the "something" that we do well when we solve arithmetic
problems? The view taken here is that the things we do well are those tasks
suited to a certain kind of computation -- namely connectionism. Difficult
tasks, such as arithmetic, need to be turned into pattern matching
problems.  That is, "we succeed in solving logical problems not so much
through the use of logic, but by making the problems we wish to solve
conform to problems we are good at solving"
(Rumelhart, Smolensky, McClelland & Hinton 1986, p. 44).
Exactly how this is done for arithmetic is the topic of this thesis.

<P> Two elementary
arithmetic skills are considered: adult memory for multiplication facts and
children's errors in long (multicolumn) multiplication.
