Different tasks lend themselves to different styles of representation
(Sloman 1985).  As a rule of thumb it makes sense to
use the most appropriate technology to model the phenomena of
interest. An example would be to use connectionism for low-level
processes (e.g., motor control), but switch to symbolic systems for
higher-level tasks, such as planning (Clary 1989).  Such hybrid views of
cognition are attractive (Thornton 1991, 1992a; Rose 1991; Hendler 1989), but
how do we know which technology is most appropriate for a given task?

This chapter reviews the symbolic models that have been built to capture
the way children learn multicolumn arithmetic.  Solving problems
like 32-27 or 49x12 involves a host of skills: not only do you
need to know the arithmetic facts, you also need to know how to
borrow and carry, which column to process next,
what to do when a number does not have a number below it
(as in 12+5), and so on.

It appears that students are following rules when solving multicolumn
problems.  Perhaps the main evidence for this comes from the observation
that children discover faulty rules (malrules) when learning arithmetic.
Hence, it seems appropriate to use something like a production system to
model multicolumn arithmetic. Indeed, to date the only systems
used to investigate arithmetic have been rule-based systems
(Brown & Burton 1978; Young & O'Shea 1981; Brown & VanLehn 1980; VanLehn 1983, 1990).

This chapter first looks at the kinds of mistakes children make when
solving multiplication problems.  The style of symbolic modelling is
then described by briefly discussing a production system for
multiplication.  Section 4.2.2 considers the Young & O'Shea (1981)
approach to modelling children's errors, and
section 4.2.3 looks at the way VanLehn (1990) has modelled
the errors.   The conclusion is that the symbolic models offer a very
plausible interpretation of children's arithmetic.  Nevertheless,
section 4.3 argues that there are good reasons for looking
into a connectionist account of the phenomena.  In particular, I aim to
show that connectionism may be an "appropriate technology" for this
domain, despite the phenomena's rule-like appearance.
Many of the assumptions
and ideas from the VanLehn and Young & O'Shea accounts are taken on
board in chapter 5 which describes a connectionist model of
multicolumn arithmetic.
