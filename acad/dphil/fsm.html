Before detailing the connectionist network used to model
arithmetic, this chapter first outlines the known features of arithmetic
that constrain the model.
The architecture, input and output
representations and training environment are then described.  The results
of simulations---the errors the network makes when solving multicolumn
problems---are presented, and the network's behaviour is
analysed.  Finally there is a discussion of how the network relates to
Sierra, and how notions like bug migration and impasses can be
accommodated.
