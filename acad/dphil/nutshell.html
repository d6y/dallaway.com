<font size=+2>Part II of the thesis</font><p>

Have you ever:
<menu>
<li> Started singing or playing one song to find yourself
playing a different song by the end?
<li> Found yourself walking or driving the route you
take everyday, even if today it isn't the route you
wanted to take?
<li> Found yourself dialing the phone and being connected
to the wrong person -- often to another friend who you
call more often?
</menu>

<P>
These are all <b>capture errors</b>.  You spend so much
of your life doing something one particular way that it
can mess up those times when you want to do something
similar, but not quite the same.  Your behaviour is captured
(pulled into) another similar, and more often practiced,
behaviour.
<P>
That's the way I think some children's errors in
arithmetic occur.  Children spend lots of time practicing
one kind of problem that it can result in errors when
they move on to other arithmetic problems.
<P>
The thesis (well, the second part) models children's
errors using neural computing and borrowing some
terminology and graphs from dynamic systems.  While
solving a problem children traverse a number of states.
Learning is all about making states distinct from each
other, but sometimes a child will be solving a problem
and will be "attracted" into a state that produces the
wrong answer.  And these states will be similar because
they play a role in similar arithmetic problems. The
child has started out trying to solve one kind of
problem and has been capture by a more familiar
problem.
