There were two main aims in writing this thesis:

<ol>
<li> To build an explicitly specified model of adult memory for
multiplication facts.
<li> To demonstrate an alternative view of children's multicolumn
arithmetic, and show that such an approach is useful.
</ol>

Chapter 2 contains a review
of the literature and previous models of adult
memory for multiplication facts.  It was noted that RTs tend to be lower
for smaller problems than larger problems, although there are exceptions to
this rule.  Most errors are operand errors---answers that are correct for a
problem that shares an operand with the presented problem.  With the
exception of McCloskey & Lindermann's MATHNET model, previous models lack
details about learning, response mechanisms or the spread of activation.
<P>
The cascade model presented in chapter 3 was trained on the
multiplication facts and captures the main aspects of the phenomena. Recall
from the network is based on a build up of activation in the hidden and
output units.  The RT is measured as the number of processing cycles
required before a
product unit exceeds some randomly selected threshold.  When the threshold
is low, incorrect products can be selected as the answer.  These errors are
mostly operand errors.
<P>
Earlier experiments used different assumptions about representation of
operands and the frequency with which problems occurred.  These experiments,
together with an analysis of the networks, suggest that the following
factors contribute towards the problem-size effect and error distribution:
variations in input representation, especially the relative "sharpness"
of the encoding; how frequently each problem occurs in the training set;
and the nature of the arithmetic facts themselves.
It also was noted that coarse encoding is equivalent to training on false
associations.  Some models assume that false associations are learned,
and some do not.  This thesis indicates that the question of interest is
not whether or not false associations are formed, but by which method they
are formed.
<P>
Preliminary simulations were presented of network damage and
recall of zero and ones problems.  Finally, possible accounts of
verification and priming were discussed.
<P>
The various network
models show some degree of consensus regarding the phenomena
associated with recall of arithmetic facts.  For example, the problem is
considered as the spread of activation between operand units and answer
units.  However, there are many interesting differences between the models,
including: input and output representation, intermediate representations,
activation rules, training assumptions.  The importance of these
differences remains to be explored.  For example, one of the assumptions in
the cascade model is that the presence
of a tie problem is made explicit in the input to the
network.  For adults tie problems are solved quickly, but for the network,
this is only achieved by the use of a tie flag. At the moment it appears
that tie problems are difficult for network models to account for without a
measure equivalent to the tie flag.

Chapter 4 described children's errors in multicolumn
multiplication.  Previous accounts of buggy behaviour were
considered---especially VanLehn's Sierra model. Sierra is an extension to
repair theory and includes an inductive learning mechanism.  VanLehn's
model predicts that when children reach impasses, general purpose repairs
are made to the local problem solver. The errors that are observed depend
on what kind of impasse occurred and which repair was carried out.
<P>
A number of observations were made of why connectionism can contribute to
this domain.  It was noted that the notion of a impasse does not directly
apply to connectionist networks: given an input, the network will produce
an output.  Networks may be able to automatically repair undefined
situations because of such properties as similarity-based processing and
automatic generalization.
<P>
Using some of the assumptions of VanLehn, and taking ideas from
Suppes et al.'s model of eye-movement, a connectionist model of
multicolumn multiplication was built (chapter 5).  To study bugs,
rather than slips, the network was trained to activate procedures to carry
out the details of multiplication, such as adding, multiplying, and keeping
track of registers.  The recurrent network was trained on problems of
ever-increasing difficulty, from 1+1 to 12x99.    During training, the
network was tested on unseen problems from the curriculum, and errors
occurred at this point.
<P>
The errors made by the system do not match the empirical observations very
well, although there are difficulties in comparing the errors to children's
errors.  The set of output operations, although sufficient for solving
multiplication problems, requires
further work to capture children's errors
in detail. An analysis of the errors made by the network shows some
interesting results.  The system is behaving as a graded state machine: it
has many of the properties of finite state machines, but does not "get
stuck" when encountering novel inputs.  Errors were characterized as
perturbations to the desired trajectory, rather than perturbations to a
rule set. The errors are a result of unlearned state transitions, and the
details of a particular error depends on its similarity to previous
experienced problems.
<P>
The state of the network was visualized by plotting the principal
components of the hidden unit activations.  Although it is not obvious that
this reduction in dimensions (from 35 hidden units to 2 axis) will provide
any interesting information about the system, in practice it does.
The mistakes made by the system are capture errors: the system is
temporarily attracted into a region of state space which
represents an arithmetic subroutine. This is clearly visible with the PCA
trajectory diagrams.
<P>
The representations learned by the system have a great deal of structure.
The model suggests that this may be exploited to account for errors without
reference to explicit impasses or repairs. It was noted that the output
layer of the network exhibits an increase in residual error at moments that
correspond to impasses. If the processing details of the network were
changed, this increase in residual error could
be observed as an increase in
RT. This raises the question of whether impasses are important moments
for the learner, or simply a by-product of the processing mechanisms.  The
model requires more work before this suggestion can be more thoroughly
explored and tested.
<P>
This is, of course, just one of many possible connectionist views of
impasses.  From the point of view of Soar, for example, Rosenbloom (1989)
suggests that connectionist impasses may occur when a number of output
units are above threshold---meaning that there is no uniquely specified
course of action to take.

<b><a name="future">6.3 Future work</a></b><P>

Specific future work, in the short- and mid-term, was outlined at the end
of chapters 3  and 5.  More general comments are
made here.
<P>
Our understanding of the representation of number and of the training
environment is poor. In both models the training environment---frequency or
order of problems---is important.  Empirical evidence needs to be
accumulated to understand what problems children actually encounter.
<P>
Experiments in part I showed that changes in the "sharpness"
of operand representation changed the results of the simulation.  In
part II, emphasis was placed on arithmetic perceptual skills, and
in particular on eye-movements. Without an understanding of these details
it will be difficult to build an appropriate operation set for the
multicolumn model. It seems that more study is needed of preschool number
abilities and foundational skills, such as number comparison and counting.
The representation of number assumed and developed by the recall network
should be applied to these other number skills.  In this way it may be
possible to determine the validity of the various representations, and
evaluate the plausibility of a product level of representation and a tens
and units level.
