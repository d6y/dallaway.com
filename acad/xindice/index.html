<h1>A day with Xindice</h1>

<p>
Over the course of a few weeks I spent about one day of effort looking at Xindice -- an pen source XML database.

<h2><a name="spec">Download</a></h2>

<p>
Xindice is in the process of becoming an Apache project, but for now is downloadable from dbxml.org.  I grabbed version 1.0b4 (released Nov 2001) and I also downloaded utilities-11042001.

Redhat 7.1

/usr/local/dbxml-10b4/
/usr/local/xindice to

set $XINDICIE_HOME and EXPORT it (the tools expect to find this)
JAVA_HOME already set for jdk 1.3.1

added $XINDICIE_HOME/bin to PATH in /etc/profile


It's the new name for dbXML
(pronounced zeen-dee-chay).


./start

books data set

xindiceadmin add_collection -c /db -n books

to create /db/books




import docs

xindice add_multiple_documents -c /db/books -f /home/richard/books/

chundered away added each file (ignoring the non-xml files I'd accidently left in the folder).


to double check, I requested the document back.  By default each file was given an id the same as the filenae@:

xindice retrieve_document -c /db/books -n i18n.xml

and it printed out the contents of the file.

NB I quickly learned that the commands can be shorted:
xindice rd -c /db/books -n i18n.xml


Running dbxml with no arguments lists the commands

See the tools reference (resources)


xindice xpath -c /db/books -q "/book[rating/@recommended='true']/title"
to get a list of all the recommended books in my database

xindice xpath -c /db/books -q "/book/body/p[1]"
to get the first para of each book



xindice xpath -c /db/books -q "/book[body/p[contains(., 'experience')]]/title"
to get all the titles where the review contains the word "experience"

Contains is actually a substring match, and according to the mailing list, will therefore
be very slow.  I dind't notice it on my small sample of documents, but I can believe it.  There's
also a mention on the mailing list about adding an xpath extentions for true text search (xpath doesn't
contain any text seach methods)

Collection of short storied from Hornby, Doyle, Fielding, Welsh, O'Farrell....

Jono handed me this collection and said "it's good, you'll like it".  Or something like that.  He was right.  Every story has been enjoyable, and mostly I've found them funny.

CODING

The XML:DB Initiative, built on top of a CORBA service.
core level 1 plus collection management and update query optional services.

Get a handle on a Database, then a Collection.

From a collection you can navigate the documents or request a service such as an XPathQuery service.

The results of a query is a ResourceSet with you can iterate over. Oddly, although you can get each individual resource as a DOM, there's no standard wrapper to get the results set as a DOM (which would be handy for rendering using XSL-T).

Very poor documentation on what is and is not thread safe.  It seems from the Xindice "addressbook" examples that Collection is thread safe.





DOM Results
