<title>Chaos: when does period doubling stop and chaos begin?</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#0099cc">

IN NOVEMBER 1990, I asked <a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/gallery/fac.html">Harry Barrow</a>
when the period doubling stopped and chaos began.  I think I said something like: "can you
draw a line on the bifurcation diagram and say 'doubling stops here and chaos begins'?".  
<P>
Harry's answer was along the lines: "Think of the period doubling as the
progression of fractions: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 ... = 2.  You know that
the progression is infinite and is doesn't go beyond 2." (I hadn't thought
of this, but it makes sense).  "So you can draw a line and say 'chaos starts
here', but the doubling goes on right up to the line".

Well, the explanation worked for me.  You may get different milage.<P>
