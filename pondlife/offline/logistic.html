This applet allows
you to change the value of <i>r</i> (the "birth rate") and then
see how the population changes over the years.

Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't appear to have a Java-enabled browser.
If you did have a Java browser,
you'd see a little application here which allows you to
change the "birth rate" parameter and see a graph of the
population changing over time. 	 This is the kind of thing you could
have seen as you changed <i>r</i>:

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="lde2.gif" border=0 width=195 height=149 alt="Period 2 graph"></td>
<td><img src="lde3.gif" border=0 width=195 height=149 alt="Period 4 graph"></td>
<td><img src="lde4.gif" border=0 width=195 height=149 alt="Chaos graph"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Period 2</td>
<td align="center">Period 4</td>
<td align="center">Yikes!</td>
</tr>
</table>

Setting <i>r</i> to be above 3.0 and you'll start to see periodic behaviour: the graph
doesn't settle down to a single value. Inch it up further and you'll see periods of 4
(<i>r</i>=3.5), 8, and so on. The doubling of periods start to come faster and faster, and then,
at about <i>r</i>=3.7 you're into chaos.  Mess around with a few values.  My favourite
is <i>r</i>=3.88989.  	 (Oh, don't set <i>r</i> below 1 because you'll kill off all the fish).

Ecologists at the time assumed that the numbers were fluctuating
around some underlying equilibrium point. (Those folk didn't have
PCs to crank the calculations out...ouch).  <a href="gleick.html">Gleick</a>
says: "...in
the back of the ecologist's minds was always the assumption that an
erratic string of numbers probably meant that the calculator
was acting up or, or just lacked accuracy."<P>
