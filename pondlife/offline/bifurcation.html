You can explore the bifurcation diagram with the applet below.  Click your
mouse button and drag to select a region.  When you let go the mouse
button you'll zoom in on your selected region.  The "zoom out" button
let's you, er, zoom out.  It takes a few seconds to draw a graph,
so watch the status line at the bottom of your browser for a progress indicator.<br>

<hr>
Your browser cannot show the Java applet that should be here.  If it
did, you'd be able to select areas on the bifurcation graph and zoom in
and out.
