<title>Chaos: WHY WOULD you bother modelling the number fish in your pond?</title>

WHY WOULD you bother modelling the number fish in your pond?  Well, because
you want to understand what the factors are that are responsible for
the fish population to boom one year, but crash the next.<P>

<blockquote>
A successful foray into mathematics for an ecologist
would let him say something like this: Here's an
equation; here's a variable representing reproductive rate;
here's a variable representing the natural death
rate; here's a variable representing the additional death rate
from starvation or predation; and look --- the population
will rise at <i>this</i> speed until it reaches <i>that</i>
level of equilibrium.

And hey, if you can understand the factors maybe you can
predict or at least plan ahead.  You could start trading
in Fish Food futures.
