<title>Chaos: bifurcation applet</title>

YOU CAN EXPLORE the bifurcation diagram with the applet below.  Click your
mouse button and drag to select a region.  When you let go the mouse
button you'll zoom in on your selected region.  The "zoom out" button
let's you, er, zoom out.  It takes a few seconds to draw a graph,
so watch the status line at the bottom of your browser for a progress indicator.<br>

Your browser cannot show the Java applet that should be here.  If it
did, you'd be able to select areas on the bifurcation graph and zoom in
and out.

<P>
So a simple little equation leads to messy, complicated behaviours (in this
case, of fish populations).

And that's about all I've got to tell you about chaos.  Now try
<a href="http://www.google.com">searching</a> the web for
"bifurcation" or "logistic difference equation" or "chaos" or
"ecology" for more information.
