<P>

All of the history in this web site comes more-or-less straight
out of Gleick's book.  Except I will have skipped bits and probably
got other bits wrong. Ah well.<P>

Anyway, my way of paying for quoting from the text is to give
you the temptimg cover blurb from the book:
<P>
<blockquote>
  Over the last decade, physicists, biologists,
astronomers and economists have created a new
way of understanding the growth of complexity in
nature. This new science, called chaos, offers a
way of seeing order and pattern where formerly
only the random, the erratic, the unpredictable--in short, 
the chaotic--had been observed. In the words of Douglas Hofstadter, "It
turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just
behind a fa&ccedil;ade of order--and yet, deep inside
the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order. "
<P>
   The science of chaos cuts across traditional
scientific disciplines, tying together unrelated
kinds of wildness and irregularity: from the turbulence of weather to the complicated rhythms
of the human heart, from the design of snowflakes to the whorls of windswept desert sands.
Highly mathematical in its origin, chaos nonetheless is a science of the everyday world, 
addressing questions that every child has wondered
about: how clouds form, how smoke rises, how
water eddies in a stream.
<P>
   In Chaos, James Gleick tells the remarkable
story of an idea--an idea that at once frightened
and fascinated the scientists who began to explore it. Gleick describes the stunning and unexpected insights of these scientists: Edward
Lorenz's discovery of the Butterfly Effect that
underlies weather's unpredictability and constancy; Mitchell Feigenbaum's calculation, prompted
by his meditations on nature and art, of a universal constant; Benoit Mandelbrot's concept of
fractals, which has created a new geometry of
nature.
<P>
   Chaos is a history of scientific discovery. It
chronicles, in the participants' own words, their
conflicts and frustrations, their emotions and
moments of revelation. It is a record of a revolution, the birth of a new science. After reading
Chaos, you will never look at the world in quite
the same way again.
